It supports various command-line options and enables real-time command execution as well as script execution.
The shell automatically searches for the full path of specified commands in the PATH environment variable.
To use Shell, you can enter commands directly into the terminal or execute a script using the -f option.
The -a option allows specifying a file to use as input for the program.
You can also specify additional options such as -b, -c, and -d to customize the behavior of the shell.
To stop the execution of Shell, you can enter the "exit" command or use Ctrl + C.
